This repository is dedicated to my experiments with <a href="https://p5js.org/">P5.js</a> framework.

"GlitchySelfie" is a small P5.js app, which try to detect a face in the picture.
If one face is found, the app applies a dataMoshing algorithm on that part of the image. If no face is found, it glitches the entire image.

Works in Chrome Browser (desktop or phone).
